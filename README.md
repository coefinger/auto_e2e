## Free and fully open-source End-to-End AI model
**AutoE2E is an open-source End-to-End AI model** which enables autonomous driving across highways, arterial roads and city streets using cameras-only, and without reliance on HD-maps. 

AutoE2E outputs can be fused with Physics-based sensors such as LIDAR/RADAR to power **fully driverless Robotaxi applications**, and the basline camera-only model can be used to enable **L2++ automotive ADAS** applications for point-to-point hands-free navigation.

To learn more about how to participate in this project, please read the [onboarding guide](/ONBOARDING.md)

## Getting started
- Install the dependencies from the **requirements.txt** file
- Visit the [Model](./Model/) folder to view the model components, run training and perform inference
- See the [Trial Guide](./TRIAL.md) for step-by-step instructions on running the inference test on AWS EC2
